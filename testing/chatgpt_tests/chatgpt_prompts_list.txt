This file is just as reference to common prompts to give to chatgpt.

Game prompt:

I'm making a game in python about space battleships that can battle each other.
Ships have modules like weapons, ammo magazines, shields, armor and so forth.
The gameplay will be a turn based combat where 2 players combat with their ships
and try and destroy the other ship by taking down critical modules and stuff.



Pygame prompt:

Now I don't know if I want to make it a text based game or with relatively low
effort 2d assets and UI. It won't be anything dynamic but feedback for the
player is nice to have to make the game more engaging. Could you sketch out a
test scene using pygame that could take into account all this?
